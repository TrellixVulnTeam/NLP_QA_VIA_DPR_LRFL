Some crime is only possible because of the identity of the offender, e.g., transnational money laundering requires the participation of senior officers employed in banks. But the FBI has adopted the narrow approach, defining white-collar crime as \"those illegal acts which are characterized by deceit, concealment, or violation of trust and which are not dependent upon the application or threat of physical force or violence\" (1989, 3). While the true extent and cost of white-collar crime are unknown, the FBI and the Association of Certified Fraud Examiners estimate the annual cost to the United States to fall between $300 and $660 billion.

Shover and Wright point to the essential neutrality of a crime as enacted in a statute. It almost inevitably describes conduct in the abstract, not by reference to the character of the persons performing it. Thus, the only way that one crime differs from another is in the backgrounds and characteristics of its perpetrators.

Organizational or corporate crime which occurs when corporate executives commit criminal acts to benefit their company by overcharging or price fixing, false advertising, etc. White-collar crime had been going on prior to Sutherland's definition and his research done in 1939. Sutherland wanted to find a general theory of the typical criminal and by reading other researchers work, getting the idea that all criminals were stereotyped as impoverished or of low social standing he found that hard to believe considering people of high social standing committed crime as well.In his book Sutherland said \"White collar crime may be defined as approximately as a crime committed by a person of respectability and high social status in the course of his occupation.\"There were many factors going into the establishment of White-collar crime but the main issue was industrialization.There is a White collar crime registry identifying those who've committed white-collar crime to the public trying to deter possible victims from being victimized.The first White Collar Crime Offender Registrywas established in Utah in 2016.", "passage_id": "White-collar crime-3"}, {"title": "Obesity in the United States", "text": "There are more obese US adults than those who are just overweight.
