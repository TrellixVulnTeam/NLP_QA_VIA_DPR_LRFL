These penalties end either when the time runs out or when the other team scores during the power play. In the case of a goal scored during the first two minutes of a double-minor, the penalty clock is set down to two minutes upon a score, effectively expiring the first minor penalty.

Major penalties are always served in full; they do not terminate on a goal scored by the other team.

While systemic elicitation of ACD in individuals sensitized by direct skin contact is well documented for a small proportion of nickel-sensitized individuals, there exists some controversy about the ability to sensitize individuals when nickel exposure is oral, intravenous, or inhaled. Only about 1\u201310% of dietary nickel is absorbed by the body. Average daily-ingested intake of nickel is about 200 micrograms. A few studies have shown that nickel-sensitive individuals given greater than 5,000 micrograms nickel (as NiSO4) as a single oral dose had a nickel ACD response. While such exposures are in excess of those encountered in normal diets, some researchers suggest that dietary control of nickel intake may help in the ongoing treatment of nickel ACD caused by other sources.

Together with chromium it gives a richer green color, used for wine bottles. Sulfur, together with carbon and iron salts, is used to form iron polysulfides and produce amber glass ranging from yellowish to almost black. In borosilicate glasses rich in boron, sulfur imparts a blue color. With calcium it yields a deep yellow color. Manganese can be added in small amounts to remove the green tint given by iron, or in higher concentrations to give glass an amethyst color. Manganese is one of the oldest glass additives, and purple manganese glass was used since early Egyptian history. Manganese dioxide, which is black, is used to remove the green color from the glass; in a very slow process this is converted to sodium permanganate, a dark purple compound. In New England some houses built more than 300 years ago have window glass which is lightly tinted violet because of this chemical change; and such glass panes are prized as antiques. This process is widely confused with the formation of \"desert amethyst glass\", in which glass exposed to desert sunshine with a high ultraviolet component develops a delicate violet tint. Details of the process and the composition of the glass vary and so do the results, because it is not a simple matter to obtain or produce properly controlled specimens. Small concentrations of cobalt (0.025 to 0.1%) yield blue glass. The best results are achieved when using glass containing potash. Very small amounts can be used for decolorizing. 2 to 3% of copper oxide produces a turquoise color. Nickel, depending on the concentration, produces blue, or violet, or even black glass. Lead crystal with added nickel acquires purplish color. Nickel together with a small amount of cobalt was used for decolorizing of lead glass. Chromium is a very powerful colorizing agent, yielding dark green or in higher concentrations even black color. Together with tin oxide and arsenic it yields emerald green glass. Chromium aventurine, in which aventurescence was achieved by growth of large parallel chromium(III) oxide plates during cooling, was also made from glass with added chromium oxide in amount above its solubility limit in glass. Cadmium together with sulphur forms cadmium sulfide and results in deep yellow color, often used in glazes. However, cadmium is toxic. Together with selenium and sulphur it yields shades of bright red and orange. Adding titanium produces yellowish-brown glass. Titanium, rarely used on its own, is more often employed to intensify and brighten other colorizing additives. Uranium (0.1 to 2%) can be added to give glass a fluorescent yellow or green color. Uranium glass is typically not radioactive enough to be dangerous, but if ground into a powder, such as by polishing with sandpaper, and inhaled, it can be carcinogenic. When used with lead glass with very high proportion of lead, produces a deep red color. Didymium gives green color (used in UV filters) or lilac red. Selenium, like manganese, can be used in small concentrations to decolorize glass, or in higher concentrations to impart a reddish color, caused by selenium nanoparticles dispersed in glass. It is a very important agent to make pink and red glass. When used together with cadmium sulfide, it yields a brilliant red color known as \"Selenium Ruby\". Pure metallic copper produces a very dark red, opaque glass, which is sometimes used as a substitute for gold in the production of ruby-colored glass. Metallic gold, in very small concentrations (around 0.001%, or 10 ppm), produces a rich ruby-colored glass (\"Ruby Gold\" or \"Rubino Oro\"), while lower concentrations produces a less intense red, often marketed as \"cranberry\". The color is caused by the size and dispersion of gold particles. Ruby gold glass is usually made of lead glass with added tin. Silver compounds such as silver nitrate and silver halides can produce a range of colors from orange-red to yellow. The way the glass is heated and cooled can significantly affect the colors produced by these compounds. Also photochromic lenses and photosensitive glass are based on silver. Tin oxide with antimony and arsenic oxides produce an opaque white glass (milk glass), first used in Venice to produce an imitation porcelain. Similarly, some smoked glasses may be based on dark-colored inclusions, but with ionic coloring it is also possible to produce dark colors (see above).", "passage_id": "Glass coloring and color marking-3"}, {"title": "Zombie", "text": "One of the first books to expose Western culture to the concept of the voodoo zombie was The Magic Island (1929) by W.

Pharyngeal slits resembling gill slits are transiently present during the embryonic stages of tetrapod development. The presence of gill-like slits in the neck of the developing human embryo famously led Ernst Haeckel to postulate that \"ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny\"; this hypothesis, while false, contains elements of truth, as explored by Stephen Jay Gould in Ontogeny and Phylogeny. However, it is now accepted that it is the vertebrate pharyngeal pouches and not the neck slits that are homologous to the pharyngeal slits of invertebrate chordates.

However, this number has been reported to be relatively low when compared to realistic rate for adolescents, which was 11 days in one year. Criteria B: persons must commit self-injure behaviors due to interpersonal problems, whether it is to alleviate unpleasant feelings and stress from such problems, or to seek positive feelings and relief. Studies have shown that females tend to expect relief from negative feelings and stress more than males. Criteria C: persons must be struggling from negative feelings and thoughts prior to NSSI, thoughts of NSSI are premeditated and constantly occupied in their minds. Criteria D: self-injure behaviors must be not socially sanctioned or minor wounds. This means that tattoos, piercings, or scab-picking are not considered as NSSI. Criteria E: NSSI-related emotional issues must be interfering with daily tasks like school/work relationships, or performances. Criteria F: NSSI must not overlap other dysfunctional episodes from other mental conditions, like withdrawal symptoms from drug abuse or eating disorders, psychosis, delirium, or substance intoxication. This criteria serves to rule out any consequential characteristics of self-injury behaviors as result of these episodes. Adolescents are the most prevalent age group for NSSI, the average age of onset is around 13\u201314 years old. Studies showed that adolescents are vulnerable to NSSI due to the sensitive transitional period in life that happens during adolescent years. NSSI is usually induced by stress and feelings of uncontrollable stress and anxiety, while adolescents and young adults face a wide range of challenging life events, different changes, along with limited mental control to protect them from self-harm decisions. Thus, a high percentage of NSSI participants admits to carrying out self-injure behaviors as a mean of coping mechanism. Adolescents also harbor external and internal factors that put them in the at-risk age group. External factors include childhood events, parenting condition, or peers. Children that went through childhood adversities are more prone to cognitive distortion that tend to permit NSSI behaviors. Severity of such adversities also play a major role in increasing risk for adolescents. Those who grew up with child maltreatment like physical/sexual or emotional abuse, household with drug-use problems, negligence, poverty, exposure to parental violence,... are more likely to develop psychopathology in later years. Women with NSSI tendency are shown to have experienced emotion negligence from both parents and insecure paternal bonding, while men with NSSI tendency are predicted to have gone through parental abandonment, mostly from father. Non physically abusive parenting can also place high susceptibility on adolescents. Parental control refers to when parents want to influence their child either by physical or emotional manipulation, while parental support implies behaviors that are encouraging, accepting, and supportive. Households with heavy use of parental control, and lack thereof of parental support, usually lead to high tendency of NSSI. Internal issues stem from emotional dysregulation and psychological distress also push individuals towards NSSI tendency.", "passage_id": "Van Gogh syndrome-4"}], "negative_ctxs": [], "hard_negative_ctxs": [], "answers": ["True"]}, {"dataset": "startegyqa", "question": "Is the span in C-SPAN named after Alan Greenspan?", "positive_ctxs": [{"title": "C-SPAN", "text": "Cable-Satellite Public Affairs Network (C-SPAN; /\u02c8si\u02d0\u02ccsp\u00e6n/) is an American cable and satellite television network that was created in 1979 by the cable television industry as a nonprofit public service.

Beyond the second coming of Jesus, bodily resurrection, and final judgment, all of which is affirmed in the Nicene Creed (325 CE), Orthodoxy does not teach much else in any definitive manner. Unlike Western forms of Christianity, however, Orthodoxy is traditionally non-dualist and does not teach that there are two separate literal locations of heaven and hell, but instead acknowledges that \"the 'location' of one's final destiny\u2014heaven or hell\u2014as being figurative.\" Instead, Orthodoxy teaches that the final judgment is simply one's uniform encounter with divine love and mercy, but this encounter is experienced multifariously depending on the extent to which one has been transformed, partaken of divinity, and is therefore compatible or incompatible with God. \"The monadic, immutable, and ceaseless object of eschatological encounter is therefore the love and mercy of God, his glory which infuses the heavenly temple, and it is the subjective human reaction which engenders multiplicity or any division of experience.\" For instance, St. Isaac the Syrian observes that \"those who are punished in Gehenna, are scourged by the scourge of love. ... The power of love works in two ways: it torments sinners ... [as] bitter regret. But love inebriates the souls of the sons of Heaven by its delectability.\" In this sense, the divine action is always, immutably, and uniformly love and if one experiences this love negatively, the experience is then one of self-condemnation because of free will rather than condemnation by God. Orthodoxy therefore uses the description of Jesus' judgment in John 3:19\u201321 as their model: \"19 And this is the judgment: the light has come into the world, and people loved the darkness rather than the light because their works were evil. 20 For everyone who does wicked things hates the light and does not come to the light, lest his works should be exposed. 21 But whoever does what is true comes to the light, so that it may be clearly seen that his works have been carried out in God.\" As a characteristically Orthodox understanding, then, Fr. Thomas Hopko writes, \"[I]t is precisely the presence of God's mercy and love which cause the torment of the wicked. God does not punish; he forgives... . In a word, God has mercy on all, whether all like it or not. If we like it, it is paradise; if we do not, it is hell. Every knee will bend before the Lord. Everything will be subject to Him. God in Christ will indeed be \"all and in all,\" with boundless mercy and unconditional pardon.

The hormonal component includes the release of adrenaline, an adrenomedullary response that occurs in response to stress and that is controlled by the sympathetic nervous system. The major emotion studied in relation to adrenaline is fear. In an experiment, subjects who were injected with adrenaline expressed more negative and fewer positive facial expressions to fear films compared to a control group. These subjects also reported a more intense fear from the films and greater mean intensity of negative memories than control subjects. The findings from this study demonstrate that there are learned associations between negative feelings and levels of adrenaline. Overall, the greater amount of adrenaline is positively correlated with an arousal state of negative feelings. These findings can be an effect in part that adrenaline elicits physiological sympathetic responses including an increased heart rate and knee shaking, which can be attributed to the feeling of fear regardless of the actual level of fear elicited from the video. Although studies have found a definite relation between adrenaline and fear, other emotions have not had such results. In the same study, subjects did not express a greater amusement to an amusement film nor greater anger to an anger film. Similar findings were also supported in a study that involved rodent subjects that either were able or unable to produce adrenaline.
